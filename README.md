# MazeSolver

## Description
This project implements an A* search algorithm to find the shortest path through a maze from a start (S) to a goal (G) point while collecting the least amount of coins.

## Features
- A* search algorithm with diagonal movement.
- Supports multiple maze sizes.
- Outputs the coin count collected through the optimal path and the number of steps as well.
